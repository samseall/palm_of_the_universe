# palm_of_the_universe


My project uses a machine learning model which recognizes your right hand. 
I built this model using Teachable Machine and imported it (line 22).

If you close your fist (Fast), you will accelerate through space (which is just the stars moving faster), if you go too fast for too long, it will caution you and reset your speed
If you open your fist (Slow), the stars will reset back to their initial position value, and your acceleration will be reset,
If you show three fingers with your palm faced inwards (Burst), the stars congregate in the middle and burst continously,
If you show two fingers with your palm faced outwards (Split), the stars will seperate into right and left directions, and continue to travel.
If you cross your fingers with both hands (Disperse), the stars will disperse into random directions and branch off.
